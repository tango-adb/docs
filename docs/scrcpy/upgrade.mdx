# Upgrade from 1.0.0

import DiffTable from "../tango/diff-table";

This page lists changes from version 1.0.0 in Scrcpy-related packages.

This version doesn't include any changes in core packages.

## `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy`

### Move version to option classes

Because now we have an option class for each Scrcpy version (including aliases for patch versions), we moved the `version` info into the option classes.

The `version` parameter has been removed from `AdbScrcpyClient.start`, `AdbScrcpyClient.getEncoders` and `AdbScrcpyClient.getDisplays`.

<DiffTable leftHeader="1.0.0" rightHeader="next">

```ts showLineNumbers
const options = new AdbScrcpyOptions2_1(
  new ScrcpyOptions3_0({
    // ...
  })
);

const client = await AdbScrcpyClient.start(adb, path, version, options);
```

<td>

```ts showLineNumbers
const options = new AdbScrcpyOptions2_1(
  new ScrcpyOptions3_0({
    // ...
  })
);

const client = await AdbScrcpyClient.start(adb, path, options);
```

</DiffTable>

If you are using the matching option class for your server binary, you don't need to specify the version. Otherwise, you can override it in the option class constructor:

```ts showLineNumbers
const options = new AdbScrcpyOptions2_1(
  new ScrcpyOptions3_0(
    {
      // ...
    },
    "3.1"
  )
);
```

## `@yume-chan/scrcpy`

### Support Scrcpy v3.1

`ScrcpyOptions3_1` and related types have been added to support new options in Scrcpy version 3.1.

### Accept raw values for complex options

We provided custom option value types from some complex options, for example `videoCodecOptions`, `scid` and `newDisplay`. Now they also accept the raw (serialized) value directly:

<DiffTable leftHeader="1.0.0" rightHeader="next">
<td>

```ts showLineNumbers
import { ScrcpyOptions3_1, ScrcpyNewDisplay } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions3_1({
  newDisplay: new ScrcpyNewDisplay(1920, 1080, 330),
});
```

</td>
<td>

```ts showLineNumbers
import { ScrcpyOptions3_1 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions3_1({
  newDisplay: "1920x1080/330",
});
```

</td>
</DiffTable>

### Fix incorrect scroll controllers in `ScrcpyOptions1_22` and later

In `ScrcpyOptions1_22` and later, the scroll controller for the mouse scroll event has been fixed.

This fixes the [`injectScroll`](./control/scroll.mdx) control message.
