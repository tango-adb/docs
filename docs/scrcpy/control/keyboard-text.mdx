# Text Input

`injectText` is a shorthand for injecting multiple keyboard events. The server converts the text to a sequence of key events and injects them into the device.

Because it's essentially a sequence of key events, only printable characters are supported. To inject Unicode text, the only method is using the device clipboard.

## Options

```ts
interface ScrcpyInjectTextControlMessage {
    text: string;
}
```

- `text`: The text content to inject into the device.

## Usage

```ts transpile
// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.injectText("Hello, world!");

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`
await writer.injectText("Hello, world!");

// Using `AdbScrcpyClient`
await client.controller!.injectText("Hello, world!");
```
