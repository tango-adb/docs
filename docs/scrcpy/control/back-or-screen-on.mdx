# Back or Screen On

This event simulates the back button if screen is on, or turns the screen on if screen is off.

Official Scrcpy client sends this event when the right mouse button is clicked. Clients can also use [keyboard events](./keyboard.mdx) to simulate the back and power button separately.

## Options

```ts
interface ScrcpyBackOrScreenOnControlMessage {
    action: AndroidKeyEventAction;
}
```

- `action`: <Version until="v1.17">Ignored. The server will inject one key down and one key up event for the back button.</Version> <Version since="v1.18">The action of the event. Allows long press on the back button. The client needs to send one key down event and one key up event to press and release the back button.</Version>

## Changelog

### v1.15

- `action` field is not supported and will be ignored. The server will inject one key down and one key up event for the back button.

### v1.18

- `action` field is added. The server will inject one key event with the specified action for the back button. The client needs to send one key down event and one key up event to press and release the back button.

## Usage

```ts transpile
import { AndroidKeyEventAction } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.backOrScreenOn(AndroidKeyEventAction.Down);

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`
await writer.backOrScreenOn(AndroidKeyEventAction.Down);

// Using `AdbScrcpyClient`
await client.controller!.backOrScreenOn(AndroidKeyEventAction.Down);
```
