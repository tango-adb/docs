# Set Clipboard

## Options

```ts
interface ScrcpySetClipboardControlMessage {
    sequence?: bigint;
    paste: boolean;
    content: string;
}
```

- `sequence`: <Version until="v1.20">Ignored.</Version> <Version since="v1.21">A sequence number for acknowledgment. When set to a non-zero value, the function returns a Promise that resolves when the device acknowledges the clipboard change. Set to `0n` to disable acknowledgment.</Version>
- `paste`: <Version until="v1.20">Ignored.</Version> <Version since="v1.21">Whether to trigger a paste action after setting the clipboard content.</Version>
- `content`: The text content to set in the clipboard.

## Usage

```ts transpile
// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.setClipboard({
    content: "Hello, world!",
    paste: false,
    sequence: 1n,
});

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`
await writer.setClipboard({
    content: "Hello, world!",
    paste: false,
    sequence: 1n,
});

// Using `AdbScrcpyClient`
await client.controller!.setClipboard({
    content: "Hello, world!",
    paste: false,
    sequence: 1n,
});
```

When using a non-zero sequence number, the returned Promise resolves when the device acknowledges the clipboard change, which may take slightly longer than when using a zero sequence number. With `sequence: 0n`, the Promise resolves immediately after sending the message, without waiting for device acknowledgment.

```ts transpile
// Immediate return without waiting for device acknowledgment
await client.controller!.setClipboard({
    content: "Quick paste",
    paste: true,
    sequence: 0n,
});

// Wait for device acknowledgment before resolving
const resultPromise = client.controller!.setClipboard({
    content: "Confirmed paste",
    paste: true,
    sequence: 1n,
});

// resultPromise will resolve when device acknowledges the operation
await resultPromise;
```
