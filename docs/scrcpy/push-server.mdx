# Push server to device

The server file needs to be copied to the device and executed on it. It will listen on a UNIX domain socket and wait for connections from the client.

The default path of the server file on device is `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. Before version 2.3, the path of Scrcpy server binary is hard-coded in the server itself. So you must push it to this exact path, otherwise the clean up steps won't delete the server file.

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```bash
adb push scrcpy-server.jar /data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar
```

:::

## With `@yume-chan/scrcpy`

`@yume-chan/scrcpy` only provides APIs to serialize and deserialize Scrcpy protocol messages. It doesn't provide any APIs to interact with the device.

## With `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy`

`@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy` package provides a `pushServer` function as a shortcut for the Tango [`AdbSync#write`](/api/adb/sync/write.mdx) call.

```ts showLineNumbers
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare class AdbScrcpyClient {
  static async pushServer(
    adb: Adb,
    file: ReadableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>>,
    filename?: string,
  );
}
```

| Parameter  | Required/Default value                                | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `adb`      | Required                                              | An `Adb` instance to run ADB commands.         |
| `file`     | Required                                              | A readable stream containing the server file.  |
| `filename` | `import("@yume-chan/scrcpy").DefaultServerPath` | The path on device to push the server file to. |

By default, it pushes to `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. This path is also exported from `@yume-chan/scrcpy` package as `DefaultServerPath`.

If a custom path is specified, the same value must be used when [starting the server](/scrcpy/start-server.mdx).

### Examples

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { AdbScrcpyClient } from "@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
      controller.close();
    },
  }),
);
```

Push to a custom path:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { AdbScrcpyClient } from "@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
      controller.close();
    },
  }),
  "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server-3.2.jar",
);
```

### Using `fetch`

When downloading the server binary using `fetch`, [`Response.body`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body) is a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` that can be directly piped to `pushServer`.

In theory, this is also faster, because the downloading and pushing are run in parallel. Although in practice, the server binary is too small to make a difference.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  // The `ReadableStream` type in TypeScript `lib.dom.d.ts` is not compatible with Tango's Web Streams API typings
  response.body as never as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
);
```

## With Tango

The above code is a shortcut for the following code:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    file: new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
        controller.close();
      },
    }),
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```

Or using `fetch`:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    // The `ReadableStream` type in TypeScript `lib.dom.d.ts` is not compatible with Tango's Web Streams API typings
    file: response.body as never as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```
