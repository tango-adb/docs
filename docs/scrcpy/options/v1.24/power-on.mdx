# powerOn

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 1.24

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether the server should power on the device when starting streaming.

By default, powering on the device is enabled in Scrcpy, meaning the server will wake up the device when starting the streaming session if it's currently off. Adding this option with a value of `true` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `false` will prevent the server from powering on the device when starting streaming.

## Related options

- [`stayAwake`](../v1.15/stay-awake.mdx): Controls whether the device stays awake during the streaming session
- [`powerOffOnClose`](../v1.18/power-off-on-close.mdx): Controls whether the device powers off when the scrcpy connection is closed

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_24 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_24({
    powerOn: false, // Don't power on device when starting streaming
});
```
