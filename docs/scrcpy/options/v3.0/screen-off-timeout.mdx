# screenOffTimeout

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 3.0

:::

* **Type**: `number | undefined`
* **Default value**: `undefined`

Controls how long the device screen should remain on after the scrcpy connection is established.

When not specified, the device will use its default timeout settings. This option allows specifying a custom timeout in milliseconds for how long the screen should stay on after connection. This option modifies the system's screen timeout setting temporarily during the scrcpy session.

## Related options

- [`stayAwake`](../v1.15/stay-awake.mdx): Prevents the device from sleeping while screen casting is active
- [`powerOffOnClose`](../v1.18/power-off-on-close.mdx): Automatically powers off the Android device when the scrcpy connection is closed

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions3_0 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions3_0({
    screenOffTimeout: 30000, // Keep screen on for 30 seconds after connection
});
```
