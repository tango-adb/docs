# listApps

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 3.0

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Lists installed applications on the device and exits.

When enabled, this option causes Scrcpy to enumerate and display all installed applications on the device, then exit without starting a streaming session. This is useful for discovering which apps are installed on the device for use with audio source filtering.

Adding this option with a value of `false` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `true` will enable app listing.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions3_0 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions3_0({
    listApps: true, // List installed apps on device
});
```
