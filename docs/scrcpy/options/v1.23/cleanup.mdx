# cleanup

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 1.23

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether the server should perform cleanup tasks on exit.

By default, cleanup is enabled in Scrcpy, meaning the server will perform various cleanup tasks when closing the connection. These tasks include:
- Deleting the scrcpy-server file from device storage
- Restoring the [`showTouches`](../v1.15/show-touches.mdx) setting to its original state
- Restoring the [`stayAwake`](../v1.15/stay-awake.mdx) setting to its original state
- Restoring the screen timeout setting modified by [`screenOffTimeout`](../v3.0/screen-off-timeout.mdx) to its original state

Adding this option with a value of `true` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `false` will disable these cleanup tasks on exit.

## Related options

- [`showTouches`](../v1.15/show-touches.mdx): Shows visual feedback for touches on the device screen
- [`stayAwake`](../v1.15/stay-awake.mdx): Prevents the device from sleeping while screen casting is active

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_23 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_23({
    cleanup: false, // Disable cleanup on exit
});
```
