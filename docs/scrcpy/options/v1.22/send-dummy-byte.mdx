# sendDummyByte

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 1.22

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether the server should send a `0` byte at the start of the video stream to detect connection issues.

By default, sending a dummy byte is enabled in Scrcpy, meaning the server sends a `0` byte at the start of the video stream to detect connection issues. Adding this option with a value of `true` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `false` will disable sending the dummy byte at the start of the video stream.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_22 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_22({
    sendDummyByte: false, // Disable sending dummy byte
});
```
