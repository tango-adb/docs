# downsizeOnError

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 1.22

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether the server should downsize the video resolution when encountering initial encoding errors during startup.

By default, downsizing on error is enabled in Scrcpy, meaning the server will attempt to retry with a lower resolution when it encounters encoding errors during the initial setup of the video stream.

This only applies to errors encountered during the first attempt to start the video encoding, not to errors that occur later during the streaming session.

If disabled (`false`), any encoding error during the initial setup will immediately cause the server to quit without attempting to use a lower resolution.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_22 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_22({
    downsizeOnError: false, // Disable downsizing on error
});
```
