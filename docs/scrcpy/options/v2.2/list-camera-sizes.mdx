# listCameraSizes

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 2.2

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Lists available camera sizes for a specific camera and exits.

When enabled, this option causes Scrcpy to enumerate and display all available camera sizes for the selected camera, then exit without starting a streaming session. This is useful for discovering which resolutions are available for use with the `cameraSize` option.

Adding this option with a value of `false` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `true` will enable camera size listing.

## Related options

- [`cameraSize`](./camera-size.mdx): Sets the camera capture size
- [`cameraId`](./camera-id.mdx): Specifies which camera to use

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions2_2 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions2_2({
    listCameraSizes: true, // List available camera sizes
});
```
