# listCameras

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 2.2

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Lists available cameras on the device and exits.

When enabled, this option causes Scrcpy to enumerate and display all available cameras on the device, then exit without starting a streaming session. This is useful for discovering which cameras are available for use with the `cameraId` or `cameraFacing` options.

Adding this option with a value of `false` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `true` will enable camera listing.

## Related options

- [`cameraId`](./camera-id.mdx): Specifies which camera to use
- [`cameraFacing`](./camera-facing.mdx): Specifies which camera facing direction to use

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions2_2 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions2_2({
    listCameras: true, // List available cameras on device
});
```
