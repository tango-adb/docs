# cameraHighSpeed

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 2.2

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Controls whether the camera should operate in high-speed mode when `videoSource` is set to `"camera"`.

By default, high-speed mode is disabled in Scrcpy. Adding this option with a value of `false` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `true` will enable high-speed mode for camera capture.

## Related options

- [`videoSource`](./video-source.mdx): Must be set to `"camera"` for this option to take effect
- [`cameraFps`](./camera-fps.mdx): Sets the camera capture frame rate
- [`cameraSize`](./camera-size.mdx): Sets the camera capture size

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions2_2 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions2_2({
    videoSource: "camera", // Enable camera source
    cameraHighSpeed: true, // Enable high-speed camera capture
});
```
