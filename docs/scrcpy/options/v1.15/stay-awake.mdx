# stayAwake

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Prevents the device from sleeping while screen casting is active.

When enabled, the device will remain awake and the screen will not turn off automatically while the scrcpy session is active. 

This option enables the "Stay awake" developer option (also known as "Keep screen on while charging"), which prevents the screen from turning off. 

It only works when the device is physically connected to a charger or computer via USB. It does not work when devices are connected wirelessly (ADB over WiFi) and not charging, as the system considers the device to be in a battery-saving state. 

This is useful when using the device remotely and you want to prevent the screen from turning off.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_15 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_15({
    stayAwake: true, // Keep device awake during session
});
```
