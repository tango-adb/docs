# sendFrameMeta

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Send presentation timestamps (PTS) so that the client may record properly.

When enabled, the video stream will include frame timing metadata required for proper recording. When set to `false`, the video stream will not contain `configuration` typed packets, which means it can't be decoded by the companion decoders. However, it's still possible to record the stream into a file or decode it with a more tolerant decoder like FFMpeg.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_15 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_15({
    sendFrameMeta: false, // Disable sending frame metadata
});
```
