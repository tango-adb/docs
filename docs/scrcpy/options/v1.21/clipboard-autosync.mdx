# clipboardAutosync

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 1.21

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether automatic synchronization of clipboard content between device and client is enabled.

By default, clipboard autosynchronization is enabled in Scrcpy, meaning the server monitors the device clipboard and sends changes to the client. Adding this option with a value of `true` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `false` will disable the automatic synchronization of clipboard content between the device and client.

Learn more about [Handling clipboard stream](../../start-server.mdx#clipboard-stream) in your application.

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions1_21 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

const options = new ScrcpyOptions1_21({
    clipboardAutosync: false, // Disable clipboard autosync
});
```
