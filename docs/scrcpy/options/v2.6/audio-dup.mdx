# audioDup

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 2.6

:::

* **Type**: `boolean`
* **Default value**: `false`

Controls whether to duplicate audio when capturing from the device.

When enabled, this option automatically sets the audio source to `"playback"` and enables audio duplication mode, which keeps the audio playing on the device while mirroring it to the client. This feature is only available when using the `"playback"` audio source (which is automatically selected when this option is enabled).

Adding this option with a value of `false` has no effect since this is the default behavior. Only setting this option to `true` will enable audio duplication mode.

Audio duplication mode is only supported on Android 13 and above, and requires the audio source to be set to `"playback"`. When enabled, audio continues to play on the device while being mirrored to the client.

## Related options

- [`audioSource`](../v2.1/audio-source.mdx): Selects the audio source for capturing audio from the device (automatically set to `"playback"` when `audioDup` is enabled)

## Example

```ts transpile
import { ScrcpyOptions2_6 } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

// Enable audio duplication mode (automatically sets audioSource to "playback")
const options = new ScrcpyOptions2_6({
    audioDup: true,
});
```
