Added in Scrcpy 2.1

:::

* **Type**:
  * <Version until="2.6">`"output" | "mic"`</Version>
  * <Version until="3.2">`"output" | "mic" | "playback"`</Version>
  * <Version since="3.2">`"output" | "mic" | "playback" | "mic-unprocessed" | "mic-camcorder" | "mic-voice-recognition" | "mic-voice-communication" | "voice-call" | "voice-call-uplink" | "voice-call-downlink" | "voice-performance"`</Version>
* **Default value**: `"output"`

Selects the audio source for capturing audio from the device.

This option allows choosing between different audio sources:

- `"output"`: Captures audio from the device's audio output (media playing, notifications, etc.). Forwards the whole audio output and disables playback on the device (mapped to `REMOTE_SUBMIX`).
- `"mic"`: Captures audio from the device's microphone (mapped to `MIC`). This is useful for using the device as a dictaphone or capturing ambient sound.
- <Version since="2.6">`"playback"`: Captures audio from the device's audio playback. Available only on Android 13 and above, and apps can opt-out from being captured. Has two benefits: supports audio duplication (keeping audio playing on the device) and allows capturing audio from specific apps.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"mic-unprocessed"`: Unprocessed microphone audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"mic-camcorder"`: Camcorder microphone audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"mic-voice-recognition"`: Voice recognition microphone audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"mic-voice-communication"`: Voice communication microphone audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"voice-call"`: Voice call uplink + downlink audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"voice-call-uplink"`: Voice call uplink audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"voice-call-downlink"`: Voice call downlink audio source.</Version>
- <Version since="3.2">`"voice-performance"`: Microphone audio source tuned for speech recognition in noisy environments.</Version>

For more advanced audio sources available on the device, see the Android documentation on `MediaRecorder.AudioSource`.
