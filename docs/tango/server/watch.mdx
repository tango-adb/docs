# Watch devices

Google ADB Server has a hidden command to notify the client about device added and removed, so you don't need to poll the device list.

```ts
import type { MaybePromiseLike } from "@yume-chan/async";
import type { Event } from "@yume-chan/event";

export interface DeviceObserver<T> {
  onDeviceAdd: Event<T[]>;
  onDeviceRemove: Event<T[]>;
  onListChange: Event<T[]>;
  current: T[];
  stop(): MaybePromiseLike<void>;
}

export declare class AdbServerClient {
  trackDevices(): Promise<AdbServerDeviceObserver>;
}

export namespace AdbServerClient {
  export interface DeviceObserver extends DeviceObserverBase<Device> {
    onError: Event<Error>;
  }
}
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

There is no equivalent ADB command.

:::

## Create an observer

The `AdbServerClient#trackDevices` method returns an `AdbServerDeviceObserver` object, which can be used to monitor device addition and removal.

```ts transpile
import { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const client: AdbServerClient;

const observer = await client.trackDevices();
```

## `onError`

The `onError` event is fired when an error occurs, like the connection to Google ADB Server is lost.

```ts transpile
observer.onError((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

## `onDeviceAdd` and `onDeviceRemove`

The `onDeviceAdd` and `onDeviceRemove` events are fired when a device is added or removed. The event argument is an array of `AdbServerClient.Device` objects that have been added or removed.

```ts transpile
observer.onDeviceAdd((devices) => {
  for (const device of devices) {
    console.log(device.serial);
  }
});

observer.onDeviceRemove((devices) => {
  for (const device of devices) {
    console.log(device.serial);
  }
});
```

## `onListChange` and `current`

The `current` field contains all the devices that are currently connected. Devices already connected when the observer is created won't fire the `onDeviceAdd` event, but they will be included in the `current` field.

When it changes, the `onListChange` event will fire with the new list. Note that with this device observer, each time the device list changes, the `current` field will be updated to a new array.

```ts transpile
for (const device of observer.current) {
  console.log(device.serial);
}

observer.onListChange((devices) => {
  console.log(devices === observer.current); // true
});
```

## Stop the observer

The `stop` method removes all the event listeners and releases all the resources. The device observer instance is no longer usable after calling `stop`.
