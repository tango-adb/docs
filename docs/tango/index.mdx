# Quick start

:::info[Welcome]

Welcome to Tango ADB's developer documentation! :tada:

Tango is a TypeScript re-implementation of ADB ([Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)) client for Web browsers, Node.js, and Electron.

If you are looking for our Tango Web application where you can control your Android devices, that's at https://app.tangoapp.dev.

:::

## Traditional Programmatic ADB Usage

Most programs that use ADB do so by spawning the Google ADB executable with specific arguments. This approach involves:

1. Installing the Google ADB executable on the system.
2. Running the executable with command-line arguments to perform desired actions, such as connecting to a device, pushing files, or executing shell commands.

For example, to pull some photo files from a device using the traditional approach, a program might execute the following command:

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/DCIM/Camera .
```

## Server Transport

Tango ADB takes a different approach by directly creating sockets to the Google ADB server. While still requiring the Google ADB executable to be present and running, this approach allows Tango ADB to:

1. Interact with the ADB server in a more efficient and robust way.
2. Provide a more programmatic and flexible way of using ADB.

| Platform |             Supported              |
| -------- | :--------------------------------: |
| Web      | Requires a native "bridge" program |
| Node.js  |                 ✅                 |
| Electron |                 ✅                 |

Because Google ADB uses TCP sockets, it's not directly supported on Web platform. To use server transport on Web platform, a native "bridge" program is required to convert TCP sockets to WebSocket.

## Daemon Transport

Tango ADB also offers a new transport mode that directly connects to the ADB daemon running on Android devices, eliminating the need for the Google ADB executable.

The daemon transport mode offers the following distinct benefits:

- **No dependency on Google ADB**: By connecting directly to the ADB daemon, Tango ADB no longer requires the Google ADB executable to be installed or running.
- **USB connections in modern Web browsers**: Using the WebUSB API, Tango ADB can establish USB connections to Android devices directly from modern Web browsers, enabling a seamless and plugin-free experience.

| Platform | USB Connection |           ADB over Wi-Fi           |
| -------- | :------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Web      |       ✅       | Requires a native "bridge" program |
| Node.js  |       ✅       |                 ✅                 |
| Electron |       ✅       |                 ✅                 |

## Installation

Tango is split into multiple packages to support different runtime environments. First, install the two core packages:

1. [`@yume-chan/adb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/adb): The platform-independent ADB client implementation
2. [`@yume-chan/stream-extra`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/stream-extra): Type definitions and utilities for [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @yume-chan/adb @yume-chan/stream-extra
```

:::note

The public API is not stable. Check [migration page](./upgrade.mdx) for changes.

If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb/discussions) :heart:

## First Step

Tango provides an `Adb` class, which contains high-level APIs for ADB commands, and also allows custom commands to be added.

The end goal is to create an `Adb` instance, but first, an `AdbTransport` object is required.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[/an AdbTransport object/] --> B["new Adb()"] --> C[\an Adb instance\]

    classDef link text-decoration: underline;
    class A,C link;

    click A "#transport"
    click C "./api/"
```

## Transport

The **AdbTransport** interface defines how to communicate with ADB Daemons (basically, your devices). ADB Daemon is the program on Android devices (when USB Debugging or Wireless Debugging options are enabled) that handles incoming ADB connections and commands.

Tango provides two built-in transports: [**Daemon Transport**](./daemon/index.mdx) and [**Server Transport**](./server/index.mdx), and also accepts [custom transport implementations](./custom-transport/index.mdx).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["adbDaemonAuthenticate()"] & H["new AdbDaemonTransport"] --> B[/an AdbTransport object/]

    subgraph C ["an AdbServerClient instance"]
        D["createTransport()"]
    end

    D & E[Custom Transport] --> B --> F["new Adb()"] --> G[\an Adb instance\]

    classDef link text-decoration: underline;
    class A,D,E,G link;

    click A "./tango/daemon/"
    click D "./tango/server/"
    click E "./tango/custom-transport/"
    click G "./api/"
```

Answer several questions to determine which transport you need:

<Question content="Where does you app run?">
    <Answer content="Web browser">
        <Question content="Where are the devices?">
            <Answer content="Connected to the same PC where your application runs">
                <Question content="Do you want to support wireless connections?">
                    <Answer content="Yes">

Wireless connection is not supported on Web platform.

[Server Transport](./server/index.mdx) can connect to Google ADB and provides connections to devices. It supports all three connection methods, including USB, ADB over Wi-Fi, and Wireless Debugging mode.

However, because Server Transport uses TCP sockets, which are not supported on Web platform, a native "bridge" app is required to convert TCP sockets to WebSocket.

```mermaid

    T["Server Transport"] -- WebSocket --> B["Bridge App"] -- TCP --> G["Google ADB"] -- Wireless Debugging --> DA["Device"]
    G["Google ADB"] -- TCP --> DB["Device"]
    G["Google ADB"] -- USB --> DC["Device"]
```

You can bundle Google ADB with your bridge app, in case of Google ADB is not installed on client PC.

We recommend implementing both Server Transport and [Daemon Transport](./daemon/index.mdx), so when Google ADB is not running, Daemon Transport can connect to Android devices over USB directly, without any plugin or download.

ADB Daemon only allows one client connection, if Google ADB has already connected to the device, we can only connect to the device through Google ADB.

You can either create your own API to expose individual features (so Tango is only used on server side), or use a [Custom Transport](#custom-transport) over WebSocket to remotely connect to the device.

You need some connection between the two PCs, for example with WebSocket or WebRTC. Exactly how to do it is out-of-scope for this documentation.
