# Upgrade from 2.1.0

import DiffTable from "../tango/diff-table";

This page lists changes from version 2.0.0 in core packages.

For changes in Scrcpy-related packages, see [this page](../scrcpy/upgrade.mdx).

## `@yume-chan/adb`

### Server client can filter devices by state

`AdbServerClient.prototype.getDevices` and `AdbServerClient.prototype.trackDevices` now accept an optional `includeStates` parameter.

It can be an array of `AdbServerClient.ConnectionState`, i.e., `"unauthorized"` | `"offline"` | `"device"`

The default value is `["unauthorized", "device"]` for backward compatibility. In a future major version, the default value will be changed to `["unauthorized", "offline", "device"]`.

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const client: AdbServerClient;

const devices: AdbServerClient.Device[] = await client.getDevices([
  "unauthorized",
  "offline",
  "device",
]);

const observer = await client.trackDevices({
  includeStates: ["unauthorized", "offline", "device"],
});
```

### Add device state to `AdbServerClient.Device`

To comply with the new API, `AdbServerClient.Device` now has a `state` property.

The old `authenticating` property is deprecated, and will be removed in a future major version. It now only returns `true` when `state` is `"unauthorized"`.

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const device: AdbServerClient.Device;

console.log(device.state); // "unauthorized" | "offline" | "device"
console.log(device.authenticating); // `true` when `device.state === "unauthorized"`
```
