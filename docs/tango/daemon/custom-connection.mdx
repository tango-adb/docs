# Custom connection

:::note

Daemon connections defines how to connect to devices directly. It works on low-level ADB packets, and generally requires exclusive device accesses.

You may also interested in [custom transports](../custom-transport/index.mdx), which works on high-level ADB sockets, and can provide shared access to a device.

:::

We have seen [`AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice`](./usb/get-devices.mdx) class in USB connection and [`AdbDaemonDirectSocketsDevice`](./tcp/create-connection.mdx#adbdaemondirectsocketsdevice) class in TCP connection, but they are high-level abstractions for managing devices. In fact, `AdbDaemonTransport` only needs a pair of [`ReadableStream<AdbPacket>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) and [`WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<AdbPacket>>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream) to work, that's what the `connect` method in those `Device` classes returns.

:::note

See [Web Streams Basics](../web-stream/index.mdx) page for a quick introduction to `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, and other types from [Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

## AdbPacket

ADB protocol is based on packets. `AdbDaemonTransport` works on deserialized `AdbPacket` objects, and a connection is responsible for transferring those packets between device and `AdbDaemonTransport`. USB and TCP connections convert them to raw bytes and send through USB or TCP, while a custom connection may transfer them using JSON, protobuf, or any other formats over TCP, WebSocket, [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport), or any other transportation.

Each `AdbPacket` is an plain object with the following fields:

- **command**: A 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **arg0**: A 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **arg1**: A 32-bit unsigned integer. `arg0` and `arg1` have different meanings for different `command`s.
- **payload**: A `Uint8Array`.
- **checksum**: A 32-bit unsigned integer calculated by summing all bytes in `payload`.
- **magic**: A 32-bit unsigned integer calculated by `command ^ 0xffffffff`.

`AdbDaemonTransport` will give the connection `AdbPacket`s with all fields filled, but the connection can omit `checksum` and `magic` fields when passing packets to `AdbDaemonTransport`, as those are not essential for basic operations.

## Create ReadableStream

As mentioned in [Web Streams Basics](../web-stream/index.mdx), it's very simple to convert pull or push style data sources into `ReadableStream`s.

### Pull style data source

For pull style data sources, simply use the `ReadableStream`:

```ts transpile
import { AdbPacketData } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare function readFromSource(): AdbPacketData | undefined;

const readable = new ReadableStream({
  pull(controller) {
    const packet: AdbPacketData | undefined = readFromSource();
    if (packet) {
      controller.enqueue(packet);
    } else {
      controller.close();
    }
  },
});
```

### Push style data source

For push style data sources, you can use `PushReadableStream` to easily convert it to a `ReadableStream`:

```ts transpile
import { AdbPacketData } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { PushReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare function onPacket(
  handler: (packet: AdbPacketData | undefined) => Promise<void>
): void;

const readable = new PushReadableStream((controller) => {
  onPacket(async (packet) => {
    if (packet) {
      await controller.enqueue(packet);
    } else {
      controller.close();
    }
  });
});
```

### Push style data source with backpressure

Ideally, if the data source supports pause and resume, you should propagate the `ReadableStream` backpressure to the source. For example, with a Node.js `Readable`:

```ts transpile
import { Readable } from "node:stream";
import { AdbPacketData } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { PushReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const source: Readable;

const readable = new PushReadableStream((controller) => {
  source.on("data", async (chunk: AdbPacketData) => {
    source.pause();
    await controller.enqueue(chunk);
    source.resume();
  });
  source.on("end", () => {
    controller.close();
  });
});
```

## Create WritableStream

The write side needs to be a `WritableStream` of `MaybeConsumable<AdbPacketInit>`:

`MaybeConsumable<AdbPacketInit>` allows the data producer to reuse the `payload` buffer, which reduces memory allocations and GC overhead to improve performance. You must call `consume` after using the value (written to a socket, copied to another buffer, etc.) to notify the producer that the value can be reused. See [consumable pattern](../consumable.mdx) page for more details.

Tango provides the `MaybeConsumable.WritableStream<T>` class to help you implement a `WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<T>>` correctly:

```ts transpile
import { AdbPacketInit } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare function writeToSink(packet: AdbPacketInit | undefined): void;

const writable = new MaybeConsumable.WritableStream<AdbPacketInit>({
  write(chunk) {
    // `writeToSink` must not use `chunk` after it returns
    writeToSink(chunk);
  },
  end() {
    writeToSink(undefined);
  },
});
```

## Create stream pair

`AdbDaemonTransport` requires a `ReadableWritablePair<AdbPacketData, MaybeConsumable<AdbPacketInit>>`, which is a plain object with `readable` and `writable` fields containing the above two streams:

```ts transpile
import { AdbPacketData, AdbPacketInit } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableWritablePair, MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const connection: ReadableWritablePair<
  AdbPacketData,
  MaybeConsumable<AdbPacketInit>
> = {
  readable,
  writable,
};
```

## Convert between raw bytes

The core package also has helper methods to convert streams between `Uint8Array` and `AdbPacket`:

```ts transpile
import { AdbPacket, AdbPacketData } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import {
  ReadableStream,
  StructDeserializeStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const rawReadable: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;

const readable: ReadableStream<AdbPacketData> = rawReadable.pipeThrough(
  new StructDeserializeStream(AdbPacket)
);
```

Note that it's not safe to unwrap a `MaybeConsumable.WritableStream`, you must consume the data in the `write` callback, or copy the data to be used later.
