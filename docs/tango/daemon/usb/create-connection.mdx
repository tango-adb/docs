# Create connection

As explained [before](./index.mdx#exclusivity), each USB device can have multiple interfaces for different functions, and each interface needs to be exclusively claimed by programs.

Requesting permission to access a device doesn't automatically claim its interfaces. The `connect` method does that, but not only that. It includes three steps to simplify the usage:

1. Call WebUSB [`USBDevice#open`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USBDevice/open) method to open the device
2. Call WebUSB [`USBDevice#claimInterface`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USBDevice/claimInterface) method to claim the ADB interface
3. Find the endpoints for the ADB interface and create streams for them

It returns a pair of streams, one for sending and one for receiving ADB packets.

```ts transpile
import type { AdbPacketData, AdbPacketInit } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { Consumable, ReadableWritablePair } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

// highlight-start
const connection: ReadableWritablePair<
  AdbPacketData,
  Consumable<AdbPacketInit>
> = await device.connect();
// highlight-end
```

If the interface is already claimed by another program (or another `USBDevice` instance), `connect` will throw an `DeviceBusyError`. You can catch it and show a message to the user to ask them to close the conflicting program.

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

function connect(device: AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice) {
  try {
    return await device.connect();
  } catch (error) {
    // highlight-start
    if (error instanceof AdbDaemonWebUsbDevice.DeviceBusyError) {
      alert(
        "The device is already in use by another program. Please close the program and try again."
      );
    }
    // highlight-end
    // It might also throw other errors
    throw error;
  }
}
```
