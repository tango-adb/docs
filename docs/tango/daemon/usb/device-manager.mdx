# Create device manager

WebUSB provides APIs for discovering and communicating with USB devices. The `AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager` class wraps the WebUSB API to better work with ADB devices.

The usage of `AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager` is different in Node.js and Web browsers:

## Web

Chromium-based browsers support WebUSB natively. Chrome for Android is supported, but Chrome for iOS is based on Safari and not supported.

<CanIUse feature="webusb" />

:::info[Secure Context Required]

WebUSB API requires a [Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). Basically it means the page must be served over HTTPS or `localhost`.

- If you have a domain name, you can easily get a free SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- If you only have an IP address, you can create a self-signed certificate and trust it in every device that will access your server (or ignore the warning every time).
- For Chromium-based browser, you can also add your origin to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.

:::

Create a device manager for browsers:

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

// highlight-start
const Manager: AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager | undefined =
  AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager.BROWSER;
// highlight-end
```

:::info

`AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager.BROWSER` is a shorthand of:

```ts
navigator.usb ? new AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager(navigator.usb) : undefined;
```

:::

In two cases, `Manager` may be `undefined`:

1. Current page isn't in a [Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts)
1. Current browser does not support WebUSB API

It's your responsibility to make sure the first case doesn't happen. So there is only one reason left:

```ts transpile
if (!Manager) {
  alert("WebUSB is not supported in this browser");
  return;
}
```

## Node.js

Node.js doesn't support WebUSB natively, but the [`usb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) package provides a WebUSB implementation for it.

It uses libusb library to access USB devices, which should work perfectly on Linux and macOS, but [may have some issues on Windows](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#windows).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i usb
```

Create a device manager using `WebUSB` from `usb` package:

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";
import { WebUSB } from "usb";

const WebUsb: WebUSB = new WebUSB({ allowAllDevices: true });
const Manager: AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager = new AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager(
  WebUsb
);
```

:::info

By default, `WebUSB` from `usb` package has the same permission system as browsers:

- Each device must be authorized separately using `requestDevice` method and [a custom `devicesFound` callback](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#use-webusb-approach-to-find-a-device-with-custom-selection-method)
- `getDevices` method only returns devices that have been authorized

Passing [`allowAllDevices: true` option](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#use-webusb-approach-to-list-all-devices) disables the permission system and returns all connected devices from `getDevices` methods.

## Electron

`AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager` can be used in either Electron renderer processes or Electron main processes. However, because of the exclusivity of USB API, you can't access a device from both renderer and main processors, or from multiple renderer processes, at the same time.

### Renderer Process

To use Tango in Electron renderer processes:

1. Enable WebUSB API in Electron following https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/devices#webusb-api
2. Follow the instructions for [Web](#web).

This allows a USB-enabled Web app to run in Electron with minimal changes.

### Main Process

To use Tango in Electron main processes, follow the instructions for [Node.js](#nodejs).

It's recommended to use Tango in main process, then expose your own API to renderer processes using Electron IPC. For example, you can modify the [server-client custom transport example](../../custom-transport/server-client/index.mdx) to share an `AdbTransport` with multiple renderer processes.
