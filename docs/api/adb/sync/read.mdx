# read

Read file content on the device filesystem.

```ts
declare class AdbSync {
  read(filename: string): ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
}
```

:::danger[READ ALL STREAMS!]

ADB is a multiplexing protocol (multiple logic streams are transmitted over one connection), so blocking one stream will block all other streams.

You must continuously read from all incoming streams (either by piping them to `WritableStream`s, using `for await` loop, or calling `reader.read()` in a loop) to prevent this from happening.

If the remaining data is not needed, `stream.cancel()` (or `reader.cancel()` if using a reader) can be called to discard them.

:::

## Example

```ts transpile
const content = sync.read("/sdcard/Download/hello.txt");
await content.pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      console.log(chunk);
    },
  }),
);
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/Download/hello.txt
```
