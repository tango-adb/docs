# read

Read file content on the device filesystem.

```ts
declare class AdbSync {
  read(filename: string): ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
}
```

:::danger[output must be used!]

`read` uses streaming output. If you don't read the output, the command will never finish, and blocking future commands from running.

:::


## Example

```ts transpile
const content = sync.read("/sdcard/Download/hello.txt");
await content.pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      console.log(chunk);
    },
  }),
);
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/Download/hello.txt
```
