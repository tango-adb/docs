# subprocess

ADB includes multiple methods to start processes on the device.

## Protocols

From the perspective of how process's input and output are transmitted to the client, there are two protocols:

- None protocol: Two ends of the ADB socket are directly bound to input and output of the subprocess. None protocol didn't have a name before Shell protocol was introduced, because it is, literally, not using any protocol.
- Shell protocol: Input and output are encapsulated in packets, allowing complex commands. Shell protocol was added in Android 7.

## Modes

From the perspective of how the subprocess is started, there are two modes:

- Raw mode: subprocess is started using `exec` series of API directly. Input/output are redirected to pipes that the spawner can read and write.
- PTY mode: subprocess is started using [pseudo-terminal (PTY)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pty.7.html) API. Input/output are forwarded by PTY kernel driver.

PTY mode simulates running the program in a terminal. For example, `less` can query the window size, and print content page-by-page. In raw mode, `less` simply prints its input continuously.

### ANSI escape sequences

ANSI escape sequences is a protocol between the program and the terminal emulator, it can do things like:

- Output colored or styled text
- Move the cursor
- Clear screen
- Handle mouse movements and clicks
- etc.

Although it's more common to use ANSI escape sequences in PTY mode (for example, some programs will automatically enable color output when running in a terminal), since they are just plain text, they can also be used in raw mode.

There are libraries like [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) that can parse and render these escape sequences:

```ts transpile
import { AdbNoneSubprocessProtocol, encodeUtf8 } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { WritableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";
import { Terminal } from "xterm";

const terminal: Terminal = new Terminal();

const process: AdbNoneSubprocessProtocol =
  await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("ls --color");
process.output.pipeTo(
  new WritableStream<Uint8Array>({
    write(chunk) {
      terminal.write(chunk);
    },
  }),
);

const writer = process.stdin.getWriter();
terminal.onData((data) => {
  const buffer = encodeUtf8(data);
  writer.write(buffer);
});

terminal.open(document.getElementById("terminal"));
```

## Combinations

Both protocols can be used with both modes, so there is a total of 4 methods to start a process.

Tango has 4 classes that precisely match the behavior of each combination. Here is a summary table, and we will explain each combination in more details later.

| Type                         | Protocol | Mode | `stdin` | `input` | `stdout` | `stderr` | `output` | `resize` | `sigint` | `exited`             |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `AdbNoneProtocolProcess`     | None     | Raw  | ✅      | ⛔      | ⛔       | ⛔       | ✅       | ⛔       | ⛔       | `Promise<undefined>` |
| `AdbShellProtocolProcess`    | Shell    | Raw  | ✅      | ⛔      | ✅       | ✅       | ⛔       | ⛔       | ⛔       | `Promise<number>`    |
| `AdbNoneProtocolPtyProcess`  | None     | PTY  | ⛔      | ✅      | ⛔       | ⛔       | ✅       | ⛔       | ✅       | `Promise<undefined>` |
| `AdbShellProtocolPtyProcess` | Shell    | PTY  | ⛔      | ✅      | ⛔       | ⛔       | ✅       | ✅       | ✅       | `Promise<number>`    |

- ✅: the field/method is present
- ⛔: the field/method isn't present

### `stdin` vs `input`

Raw mode has `stdin`, and PTY mode has `input`.

This is because in PTY mode, the input is sent to PTY kernel driver, and some data is handled in the driver directly. For example, writing `0x03` will send a `SIGINT` to the foreground process, instead of writing `0x03` as-is to the process's stdin.

In raw mode, all data written to `stdin` will be forwarded to the subprocess directly.

### `stdout` + `stderr` vs `output`

None protocol raw mode has `output`: None protocol only has one output stream, containing content from both `stdout` and `stderr`.

Shell protocol raw mode has `stdout` and `stderr`: Shell protocol redirects the subprocess's `stdout` and `stderr` to different pipes, then uses different packet IDs to send them to the client separately.

Both None protocol and Shell protocol in PTY mode only has `output`: PTY API also sends `stdout` and `stderr` together, so there is only one `output`.

:::danger[READ ALL STREAMS!]

ADB is a multiplexing protocol (multiple logic streams are transmitted over one connection), so blocking one stream will block all other streams.

You must continuously read from all incoming streams (either by piping them to `WritableStream`s, using `for await` loop, or calling `reader.read()` in a loop) to prevent this from happening.

If the remaining data is not needed, `stream.cancel()` (or `reader.cancel()` if using a reader) can be called to discard them.

:::

### `resize`

Only Shell protocol PTY mode supports changing the size of the PTY.

### `sigint`

Only available in PTY mode.

A shortcut method to write `0x03` to the PTY input, to send a `SIGINT` to the foreground process.

This is same as pressing `Ctrl + C` on the keyboard.

### `exited`

None protocol doesn't send the exit code to client, so their `exited` `Promise` only resolves to `undefined`.

Shell protocol sends an exit code packet to the client, and their `exited` resolves to the exit code. The exit code is an unsigned byte, thus in the range of 0 to 255.

## How to choose

### Protocol

If Shell protocol has more features than None protocol on both modes, why do you still want to use None protocol?

Because None protocol has two advantages:

- Compatibility: None protocol is supported by all Android devices, while Shell protocol was added in Android 7.
- Performance: None protocol has less protocol overhead, so it's faster. In some test it can be 150% faster than Shell protocol.

When do you want to use Shell protocol?

- Compatibility is not an issue, and
- You need separated `stdout` and `stderr`, or you need the exit code.

### Mode

To programmatically start a process and parse its output, raw mode should be enough.

PTY mode is mainly for creating interactive terminal emulators. Some interactive programs works differently in raw and PTY mode, and some (like `less`) are only useful in PTY mode.

Shell protocol PTY mode provides the `resize` method, allowing synchronizing the pseudo terminal size to your terminal emulator window size, improving user experience.

## API

The subprocess APIs are grouped by protocol:

```ts showLineNumbers
import type {
  AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService,
  AdbShellProtocolSubprocessService,
} from "@yume-chan/adb";

export declare class AdbSubprocessService {
  get noneProtocol(): AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService;
  get shellProtocol(): AdbShellProtocolSubprocessService | undefined;
}

export declare class Adb {
  readonly subprocess: AdbSubprocessService;
}
```

If the device doesn't support Shell protocol, `adb.subprocess.shellProtocol` will be `undefined`.

```ts transpile
if (!adb.subprocess.shellProtocol) {
  throw new Error("Shell protocol is not supported");
}
```
