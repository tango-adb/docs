# None protocol

```ts showLineNumbers
export declare class AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService {
  spawn(
    command: string | string[],
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): Promise<AdbNoneProtocolProcess>;

  pty(command?: string | string[]): Promise<AdbNoneProtocolPtyProcess>;
}
```

An instance of `AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService` is available at `adb.subprocess.noneProtocol`.

## `spawn`

Start a process in raw mode.

```ts showLineNumbers
import type { MaybePromiseLike } from "@yume-chan/async";
import type {
  MaybeConsumable,
  ReadableStream,
  WritableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

export interface AdbNoneProtocolProcess {
  get stdin(): WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>>;
  get output(): ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
  get exited(): Promise<void>;

  kill(): MaybePromiseLike<void>;
}

export declare class AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService {
  spawn(
    command: string | string[],
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): Promise<AdbNoneProtocolProcess>;
}
```

### `command`

The `command` parameter can either be a single string, or an array of strings

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("ls -al /");
// same as
await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn(["ls", "-al", "/"]);
```

#### Escaping arguments

Because the command is executed by a shell, and different shells have different escaping rules, we can't escape the command automatically.

If the command is an array, whitespace characters in an element will split the argument into two:

```ts transpile
adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn(["mv", "a b", "c d"]);
// is actually
adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn(["mv", "a", "b", "c", "d"]);
```

A `escapeArg` method is provided which follows basic sh rules. It uses single quotes to wrap the argument, meaning that it will also prevent shell expansion:

```ts transpile
import { escapeArg } from "@yume-chan/adb";

adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn(["mv", escapeArg("a b"), escapeArg("c d")]);
// evaluates to
adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("mv 'a b' 'c d'");
```

### `signal`

A optional `AbortSignal` to kill the process.

When the process is killed by `signal`:

- [`stdin`](#stdin) will be closed, writing to it will throw an error.
- [`output`](#output) will be closed after all buffered data is consumed.
- [`exited`](#exited) will be rejected with `signal.reason`.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

const abortController = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => abortController.abort(), 1000);

const process = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn(
  "logcat",
  abortController.signal
);
```

### `stdin`

Writes to the process's stdin.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { encodeUtf8 } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

// `cat` will output whatever is written to its `stdin`
const process = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("cat");
const writer = process.stdin.getWriter();
await writer.write(encodeUtf8("Hello World!"));

for await (const chunk of process.output.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())) {
  console.log(chunk); // "Hello World!"
  await process.kill();
}
```

#### Closing `stdin`

None protocol doesn't support closing `stdin` stream manually, so if the child process keeps reading from it, it will hang (like the `cat` example above).

If closing `stdin` feature is required, use [Shell protocol](./shell-protocol.mdx#closing-stdin) instead.

If you know when the child process can be stopped, use [`signal`](#signal) or [`kill()`](#kill) to stop it manually.

### `output`

Read from the process's `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream ends when the process exits.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

const process = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("ls -al /");
for await (const chunk of process.output.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

:::danger[READ ALL STREAMS!]

ADB is a multiplexing protocol (multiple logic streams are transmitted over one connection), so blocking one stream will block all other streams.

You must continuously read from all incoming streams (either by piping them to `WritableStream`s, using `for await` loop, or calling `reader.read()` in a loop) to prevent this from happening.

If the remaining data is not needed, `stream.cancel()` (or `reader.cancel()` if using a reader) can be called to discard them.

:::

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```sh
adb exec-out ls -al /
```

Note: `adb exec-out` doesn't forward `stdin` to the process, so it's not 100% equal.

:::

### `exited`

A `Promise` that resolves when the process exits.

If the process is killed by `signal`, its `exited` promise will be rejected with `signal.reason`.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

const process = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("sleep 1");
await process.exited; // Resolves after 1 second
```

### `kill`

Forcefully kill the process.

If there are any remaining data in `output`, they can still be read after the process has exited.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { TextDecoderStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

const process = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("logcat");
setTimeout(() => process.kill(), 1000);

for await (const chunk of process.output.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

## `spawn.wait`

The result of `spawn` is a mixin between `Promise<AdbNoneProtocolProcess>` and a `Wait` helper.

It provides a simple way to wait for the process to exit, and read its output.

```ts showLineNumbers
export interface WaitOptions {
  stdin?: ReadableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>> | undefined;
}

export interface Wait {
  wait(options?: WaitOptions): Promise<Uint8Array>;
}
```

Basic usage:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const adb: Adb;

const output: Uint8Array = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol
  .spawn("ls -al /")
  .wait();
```

Optionally, you can provide a `stdin` stream to write to the process's stdin.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb, encodeUtf8 } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;

const output: Uint8Array = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol.spawn("cat").wait({
  stdin: new ReadableStream<Uint8Array>({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(encodeUtf8("Hello World!"));
    },
  }),
});
```

Note that `cat` doesn't work with `wait`, as it will wait for the `stdin` to be closed before exiting, but [None protocol doesn't support closing `stdin` stream manually](#closing-stdin).

## `spawn.wait.toString`

The result of `spawn.wait` is also a mixin between `Promise<Uint8Array>` and a `WaitToString` helper.

It does the same thing as `wait`, but decodes the output to a UTF-8 string.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const adb: Adb;

const output: string = await adb.subprocess.noneProtocol
  .spawn("ls -al /")
  .wait()
  .toString();
```

## `pty`

Start a process in PTY mode.

```ts showLineNumbers
export declare class AdbNoneProtocolPtyProcess {
  get input(): WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>>;
  get output(): ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
  get exited(): Promise<undefined>;

  sigint(): Promise<void>;
  kill(): MaybePromiseLike<void>;
}

export declare class AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService {
  pty(command?: string | string[]): Promise<AdbNoneProtocolPtyProcess>;
}
```

`input`, `output`, `exited` and `kill` is basically same as raw mode's [`stdin`](#stdin), [`output`](#output), [`exited`](#exited) and [`kill`](#kill).

### `command`

If `command` parameter is `undefined`, the default shell will be started.

### `sigint`

A shortcut method to write `0x03` to the PTY input, to send a `SIGINT` to the foreground process.
