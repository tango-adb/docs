# Activity Manager (`am`)

The `am` (Activity Manager) executable is Android's command-line tool for managing activities and broadcasting intents. It handles launching activities, sending broadcasts, and managing application lifecycle events on Android devices.

## Overview

The `am` executable provides various operations for Android activity management:

- Starting activities with specific intents, actions, and components
- Broadcasting intents to registered receivers
- Managing application lifecycle with options for user targeting and display control
- Supporting compatibility across different Android API levels

## Creating an ActivityManager Instance

The `@yume-chan/android-bin` library provides an `ActivityManager` class that wraps the `am` executable with enhanced functionality and cross-version compatibility.

```ts
import { ActivityManager } from "@yume-chan/android-bin";

// highlight-start
const activityManager = new ActivityManager(adb, apiLevel);
// highlight-end
```

The `ActivityManager` constructor accepts two parameters:

1. `adb`: An authenticated ADB connection instance
2. `apiLevel`: The target device's Android API level (optional)

### API Level Compatibility

The `apiLevel` parameter enables behavior normalization across different Android versions. The `ActivityManager` class automatically adjusts command routing based on the provided API level:

- **Command routing**: On older Android versions (API level ≤ 25), commands are routed through the direct `am` executable. On newer versions, commands use the `cmd activity` interface for better performance and reliability.
- **Feature availability**: Certain options and behaviors are adjusted based on the Android version to ensure compatibility.

## Available Methods

- [startActivity](./start-activity) - Starts an Android activity with specified options
- [broadcast](./broadcast) - Sends a broadcast intent to registered receivers
- [Intent Format](./intent-format) - Details about the Intent interface and its properties
