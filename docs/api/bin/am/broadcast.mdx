# broadcast

The `broadcast` method sends an intent as a broadcast to registered receivers on the device.

## Signature

```ts
async broadcast(
    intent: Intent,
    options?: { user?: SingleUserOrAll; receiverPermission?: string }
): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

The `broadcast` method takes two parameters:

1. `intent`: An [`Intent`](./intent-format.mdx) object describing the broadcast
2. `options` (optional): Additional options including:
   - `user`: Target a specific user for the broadcast
   - `receiverPermission`: Require receivers to hold a specific permission

## Usage

```ts
await activityManager.broadcast({
    action: "android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED",
    extras: {
        level: 80,
        scale: 100
    }
}, {
    user: 0,
    receiverPermission: "android.permission.BROADCAST_STICKY"
});
```

The method returns a promise that resolves when the broadcast is sent.
