# getDeviceFeatures

```ts showLineNumbers
declare class AdbServerClient {
  getDeviceFeatures(
    selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector
  ): Promise<{ transportId: bigint; features: AdbFeature[] }>;
}
```

Gets the ADB features supported by the device. Tango needs to know which features the device supports, to coordinate the behavior of ADB commands.

For example, if [Shell protocol](/api/adb/subprocess.mdx#none-protocol-vs-shell-protocol) is not supported by the device, using `AdbSubprocessShellProtocol` will immediately throw an error.

Usually you don't need to call this method directly, the `createTransport` method calls it internally to create a `AdbTransport` object.

For convenience, Tango uses a special form of this command to get both `transportId` and `features` list in one call. The `transportId` value is useful to send subsequent commands to the same device if the `selector` argument is not using `transportId` to pinpoint the target.
