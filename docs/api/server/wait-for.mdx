# `waitFor`

```ts
namespace AdbServerClient {
  interface ServerConnectionOptions {
    unref?: boolean | undefined;
    signal?: AbortSignal | undefined;
  }
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  waitFor(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector,
    state: "device" | "disconnect",
    options?: AdbServerClient.ServerConnectionOptions
  ): Promise<void>;
}
```

Wait for a device to be connected or disconnected. This method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the condition is met.

If the selector is `usb`, `tcp` or `undefined`, it won't tell which device is connected or disconnected.

## State

### `device`

Wait for a device to be available.

### `disconnect`

Wait for a device to be disconnected.

This state requires [server version 41](../../internal/version.mdx#v41) or higher, otherwise an "unknown host service" error will be thrown.

If `device` parameter is a transport ID selector, you can use `waitForDisconnect` method instead, which fallbacks to [`trackDevices`](./track-devices.mdx) for server version below 41.

## Options

### `unref`

If the underlying connection is using Node.js `net` module, then [`unref`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#socketunref) the socket, so the process can exit even if the connection is still alive.

### `signal`

Stops waiting when the signal is aborted.

```sh
adb wait-for[-TRANSPORT]-STATE
```

For example:

```sh
adb wait-for-device
adb wait-for-usb-device
adb wait-for-disconnect
adb wait-for-usb-disconnect
```
