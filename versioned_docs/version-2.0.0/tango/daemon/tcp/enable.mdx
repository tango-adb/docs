# Enable ADB over Wi-Fi

ADB over Wi-Fi allows you to connect to your device wirelessly. This is useful when you want to connect to your device without using a USB cable, or if you want to connect multiple devices to the same computer.

## Android 11 and above

Android 11 added a Wireless Debugging feature in Developer Options, which allows you connect to the device wirelessly.

However, Wireless Debugging is different from ADB over Wi-Fi, and not supported by Tango.

Technical details:

* Wireless Debugging uses mDNS to automatically discover devices in the same network.
  * It's not implemented on Windows
  * Some Linux distributions compiles ADB themselves, and doesn't include mDNS support.
* Wireless Debugging uses TLS to validate the client and encrypt the connection.
* Wireless Debugging adds trusted client certificates using the new ADB pairing feature.

## Rooted devices

On rooted devices, ADB over Wi-Fi can be enabled by running the following command on the device:

```sh
su
setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
stop adbd
start adbd
```

`5555` is the port ADB daemon will listen at, and can be freely changed.

## Other devices

On non-rooted devices with Android 10 and below, enabling ADB over Wi-Fi requires first connecting the device using a USB cable.

- To enable ADB over Wi-Fi using Google ADB, run the following command in a terminal:

  ```sh
  adb tcpip 5555
  ```

  `5555` is the port ADB daemon will listen at, and can be freely changed.

- To enable ADB over Wi-Fi using Tango, use the [`tcpip` command](/api/adb/tcpip.mdx).

When device is restarted, ADB over Wi-Fi will be disabled. To re-enable it, connect the device using a USB cable and follow the steps above again.
