# videoCodec

:::info

Added in Scrcpy 2.0

:::

* **Type**: `"h264" | "h265" | "av1"`
* **Default value**: `"h264"`

Specifies the video codec to use by the server.

The specified `videoCodec` must be supported by the device (has an encoder for it), otherwise an error will be thrown in the startup process.

It's also recommended to use a hardware-based encoder for best experience. From Scrcpy 3.0, the output of `--list-encoders` (or `AdbScrcpyClient.getEncoders` method) will include the hardware type of each encoder.

## H.264

H.264 is the default value, and the only supported video codec in earlier versions of Scrcpy.

Most devices since Android 5 has hardware-based H.264 encoders.

## H.265 (HEVC)

H.265 can provide better video quality at the same bitrate compared to H.264.

H.265 encoder is not required by Google, but many devices since Android 7 have hardware-based H.265 encoders.

## AV1

AV1 can provide even better video quality at the same bitrate compared to H.265.

AV1 encoder is mandatory since Android 14, however, the built-in, software-based encoder by Google is too slow to be used in production.

Support for hardware-based AV1 encoders can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#Hardware.
