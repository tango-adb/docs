Manage reverse port forwarding.

Reverse port forwarding (reverse tunnel) allows you to listen on a socket address on the device. When an app on Android connects to that address, the connection can be handled by your program on the host.

## Errors

```ts
declare class AdbReverseError extends Error {}

declare class AdbReverseNotSupportedError extends AdbReverseError {}
```

ADB daemon on Android 8 and below had a bug that prevented reverse port forwarding from working when ADB is connected over Wi-Fi. When this happens, an `AdbReverseNotSupportedError` will be thrown.

ADB daemon may also return other errors, a general `AdbReverseError` will be thrown in this case. The `message` field contains a human-readable error message from ADB Daemon.

## Commands

* [`add` / `addExternal`](./add.mdx): Add a reverse port forwarding.
* [`list`](./list.mdx): List all reverse port forwardings.
* [`remove` / `removeAll`](./remove.mdx): Remove reverse port forwardings.
