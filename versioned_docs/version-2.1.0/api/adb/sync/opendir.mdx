# opendir/readdir

List files in a directory

```ts
interface AdbSyncEntry extends AdbSyncStat {
  mode: number;
  size: bigint;
  mtime: bigint;
  get type(): LinuxFileType;
  get permission(): number;

  uid?: number;
  gid?: number;
  atime?: bigint;
  ctime?: bigint;

  name: string;
}

declare class AdbSync {
  opendir(path: string): AsyncGenerator<AdbSyncEntry, void, void>;
  readdir(path: string): Promise<AdbSyncEntry[]>;
}
```

`opendir` returns an async generator that yields file entries in the directory. `readdir` collects all entries and returns an array.

For a large directory with hundreds of files, `readdir` may take tens of seconds to finish. `opendir` can provide a better user experience by yielding entries as they are received.

## Example

### Use `opendir`

```ts transpile
for await (const entry of sync.opendir('/sdcard')) {
  console.log(entry.name);
}
```

:::danger[READ ALL STREAMS!]

ADB is a multiplexing protocol (multiple logic streams are transmitted over one connection), so blocking one stream will block all other streams.

You must continuously read from all incoming streams (either by piping them to `WritableStream`s, using `for await` loop, or calling `reader.read()` in a loop) to prevent this from happening.

For example, you can't create another sync connection or call other methods on `Adb` when `opendir` is still running. Upcoming data for `opendir` will block other operations.

:::

### Use `readdir`

```ts transpile
const entries = await sync.readdir("/sdcard");
for (const entry of entries) {
  console.log(entry.name);
}
```
