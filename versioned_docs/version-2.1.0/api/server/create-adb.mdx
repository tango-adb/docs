# createAdb

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare class AdbServerClient {
  createAdb(device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector): Promise<Adb>;
}
```

Creates an `Adb` object for the device.

It's a shortcut for [`client.createTransport(device)`](./create-transport.mdx) and `new Adb(transport)`.

`AdbTransport` is a low-level API, `Adb` is a higher-level API.

## Example

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient, Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";

declare const client: AdbServerClient;

const adb: Adb = await client.createAdb({
  transportId: 123n,
});
```
