# createDeviceConnection

```ts showLineNumbers
namespace AdbServerClient {
  interface Socket extends AdbSocket {
    transportId: bigint;
  }
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  createDeviceConnection(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector,
    service: string
  ): Promise<AdbServerClient.Socket>;
}
```

Creates a socket to the ADB daemon on the device, letting the server forward packets between the client and the device.

## Parameters

### `device`

A [device selector](./selector.mdx).

Using selectors other than transport IDs requires [server version 41](../../internal/version.mdx#v41) or higher. Transport ID selectors are recommended anyway.

### `service`

An [ADB command](../index.mdx#adb-from-yume-chanadb), or a [socket address](../adb/socket.mdx#forward-tunnel) on device to connect to.


## Remarks

Usually you don't need to call this method directly. [`createTransport`](./create-transport.mdx) method uses it internally to implement `AdbTransport`.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]
