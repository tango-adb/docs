# Device filter

Without specifying the `options` parameter, WebUSB [`requestDevice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB/requestDevice#filters) method will show all connected devices in the picker.

This obviously isn't the best user experience. Luckily, it accepts `filters` and `exclusionFilters` options to select which devices to show in the picker.

## `USBDeviceFilter`

The `filters` and `exclusionFilters` options are `USBDeviceFilter` objects, which have the following fields:

```ts
interface USBDeviceFilter {
  vendorId?: number | undefined;
  productId?: number | undefined;
  classCode?: number | undefined;
  subclassCode?: number | undefined;
  protocolCode?: number | undefined;
  serialNumber?: string | undefined;
}
```

Some fields must be specified in pairs:

- When `productId` is specified, `vendorId` must also be specified.
- When `protocolCode` is specified, `subclassCode` must also be specified.
- When `subclassCode` is specified, `classCode` must also be specified.

If a `USBDeviceFilter` has multiple fields, the device must match all fields to be included. If `classCode`, `subclassCode` or `protocolCode` fields are present, they require the device to have at least one matching interface.

Some lazy manufacturers use the same `serialNumber` for all devices. So even if `serialNumber` is specified, it's still possible that multiple devices will be returned.

:::

## `filters` option

If the `options` parameter is specified, the `filters` field is required. It is an array of `USBDeviceFilter` objects, devices must match at least one filter to be included in the picker.

For example, to only allows a specific manufacturer and model pair:

```ts
const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

To allow multiple manufacturers/models:

```ts
const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
    {
      vendorId: 0x04e8,
      productId: 0x6860,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

## `exclusionFilters` option

The `exclusionFilters` option is also an array of `UsbDeviceFilter`s similar to `filters`, but it excludes devices that match any filter in the array. It has a higher priority than `filters`.

:::info

Support for exclusive filters was added in Chrome 105. It will be ignored in older versions.

:::

For example, to exclude devices that are already paired:

```ts transpile
declare const devices: USBDevice[];

const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
  filters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-start
  exclusionFilters: devices.map((device) => ({
    serialNumber: device.serialNumber,
  })),
  // highlight-end
});
```

Because the `filters` option is required, to only use the `exclusionFilters` option, the `filters` array can be empty:

```ts transpile
manager.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [],
  // highlight-end
  exclusionFilters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Filters in Tango

Tango also uses the `USBDeviceFilter` interface for selecting devices, but the `classCode`, `subclassCode`, and `protocolCode` fields in `filters` option have an extra meaning: they specifies which interface to use for communication with ADB daemon.

Google ADB defines those values as `{ classCode: 0xFF, subclassCode: 0x42, protocolCode: 1 }`. If a `USBDeviceFilter` in the `filters` option doesn't have those fields, this default values will be used. If you have a special device with different configurations, you need to specify the correct values.

Because the presence of the default value, Tango allows the `filters` option to be omitted. So all the following lines are equivalent:

```ts
manager.requestDevice();
manager.requestDevice({ filters: undefined });
manager.requestDevice({ filters: [] });
manager.requestDevice({ filters: [{}] });
```
