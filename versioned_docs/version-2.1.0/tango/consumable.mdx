# Consumable pattern

The `Consumable` pattern is intended to be used with [Web Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/). It allows the consumer to notify the producer when the value is no longer needed.

## The problem

In Web Streams API, because `ReadableStreamDefaultController.prototype.enqueue` is a synchronous method, which returns immediately after the data is enqueued, the `ReadableStream` can't wait for the data to be consumed. For example:

```ts showLineNumbers
const buffer = new Uint8Array(1);

const readable = new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    // highlight-start
    buffer[0] = 1;
    controller.enqueue(buffer);
    console.log("enqueue", 1);

    buffer[0] = 2;
    controller.enqueue(buffer);
    console.log("enqueue", 2);
    // highlight-end

    controller.close();
  },
});

const transform = new TransformStream({
  transform(chunk, controller) {
    // highlight-start
    console.log("transform", chunk[0]);
    controller.enqueue(chunk);
    // highlight-end
  },
});

const writable = new WritableStream({
  write(chunk) {
    // highlight-start
    console.log("write", chunk[0]);
    // highlight-end
  },
});

await readable.pipeThrough(transform).pipeTo(writable);
```

The output will be:

```text
enqueue 1
enqueue 2
transform 2
write 2
transform 2
write 2
```

This means a `ReadableStream` can't just allocate one object (e.g. `Uint8Array`), then enqueue it multiple times with different content (doing this can reduce memory allocations and GC pressure). The consumer will only receive the last content.

:::info

This issue only happens when using `ReadableStream.prototype.pipeTo` or `ReadableStream.prototype.pipeThrough`.

When not using `ReadableStream`s, but using `WritableStreamDefaultWriter.prototype.write` method to write data directly, it will return a `Promise` that resolves after the data is written to the sink.

But in most times, we will use `ReadableStream`s and pipe them around.

:::

## `Consumable<T>`

The `Consumable` class is a wrapper around a value of type `T`. It allows the consumer to notify the producer when the value is no longer needed.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

function useData(data: Consumable<Uint8Array>) {
  console.log(data.value); // use the value
  data.consume(); // notify the producer
}

async function produceData() {
  const data = new Consumable(new Uint8Array([1]));
  useData(data);
  await data.consumed;
}
```

To re-write the previous example using `Consumable` pattern:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  Consumable,
  ReadableStream,
  TransformStream,
  WritableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const buffer = new Uint8Array(1);

const readable = new ReadableStream({
  async start(controller) {
    buffer[0] = 1;

    // highlight-start
    const consumable1 = new Consumable(buffer);
    controller.enqueue(consumable1);
    await consumable1.consumed;
    console.log("enqueue", 1);
    // highlight-end

    buffer[0] = 2;

    // highlight-start
    const consumable2 = new Consumable(buffer);
    controller.enqueue(consumable2);
    await consumable2.consumed;
    console.log("enqueue", 2);
    // highlight-end

    controller.close();
  },
});

const transform = new TransformStream({
  transform(chunk, controller) {
    // highlight-start
    console.log("transform", chunk.value[0]);
    // highlight-end
    controller.enqueue(chunk);
  },
});

const writable = new WritableStream({
  write(chunk) {
    console.log("write", chunk.value[0]);
    // highlight-start
    chunk.consume();
    // highlight-end
  },
});

await readable.pipeThrough(transform).pipeTo(writable);
```

Here, we create a `Consumable` for each `enqueue` operation, and `await` for the `consumed` promise to be settled before modifying the buffer.

It doesn't completely eliminate allocations, but if the size of `Consumable` objects is smaller than the `Uint8Array` you're enqueuing (which is the usual case), it's still beneficial.

This time the output will be:

```text
transform 1
write 1
enqueue 1
transform 2
write 2
enqueue 2
```

### `Consumable.ReadableStream`

To simplify using `Consumable` with `ReadableStream`s, you can use `Consumable.ReadableStream`:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const buffer = new Uint8Array(1);

const readable = new Consumable.ReadableStream({
  async start(controller) {
    buffer[0] = 1;

    // highlight-start
    await controller.enqueue(buffer);
    // highlight-end
    console.log("enqueue", 1);

    buffer[0] = 2;

    // highlight-start
    await controller.enqueue(buffer);
    // highlight-end
    console.log("enqueue", 2);

    controller.close();
  },
});

const transform = new TransformStream({
  transform(chunk, controller) {
    console.log("transform", chunk.value[0]);
    controller.enqueue(chunk);
  },
});

const writable = new WritableStream({
  write(chunk) {
    console.log("write", chunk.value[0]);
    chunk.consume();
  },
});

await readable.pipeThrough(transform).pipeTo(writable);
```

The `enqueue` method is now asynchronous, and returns a `Promise` that resolves when the value is consumed.

:::danger

You must `await` the returned `Promise` for `Consumable`s to work properly.

:::

### `tryConsume`

`Consumable.prototype.tryConsume` method is a helper method to consume the value by calling a callback:

```ts showLineNumbers
declare class Consumable<T> {
  tryConsume<U>(callback: (value: T) => U): U;
}
```

`tryConsume` invokes the callback immediately with the inner value.

If the callback returns a `Promise`, `tryConsume` will wait for the `Promise` to be settled before marking the `Consumable` as consumed. Otherwise, `tryConsume` will mark the `Consumable` as consumed when the callback completes (returns or throws).

```ts transpile
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

function useData(data: Consumable<Uint8Array>) {
  // highlight-start
  data.tryConsume((value) => {
    console.log(value);
  });
  // highlight-end
}

function useDataAsync(data: Consumable<Uint8Array>) {
  // highlight-start
  data.tryConsume(async (value) => {
    // Can be async
    await delay(1000);
    console.log(value);
  });
  // highlight-end
}
```

It also forwards (returns) the callback's return value:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Consumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const consumable = new Consumable(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
const result = consumable.tryConsume((value) => {
  return 42;
});

console.log(result); // 42
```

#### Improve debugging experience

Normally, when piping data around streams, Chrome DevTools doesn't track the data flow, so the call stack is always empty:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { ReadableStream, WritableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));
    controller.close();
  },
}).pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      // highlight-start
      debugger; // Here the call stack is empty: it doesn't tell you where the `chunk` comes from
      // highlight-end
    },
  })
);
```

An additional feature of `Consumable` is that it uses [`console.createTask`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-modern-web-debugging/) to capture the call stack where it was created.

When paired with `tryConsume`, Chrome DevTools will show the `Consumable`'s creation site as async call stack:

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  Consumable,
  ReadableStream,
  WritableStream,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(new Consumable(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])));
    controller.close();
  },
}).pipeTo(
  new WritableStream({
    write(chunk) {
      // highlight-start
      chunk.tryConsume((value) => {
        debugger; // The call stack will point to line 9 (`new Consumable(...)`)
      });
      // highlight-end
    },
  })
);
```

## `MaybeConsumable<T>`

Not all producers need the consumable pattern. Their data might be very lightweight, or they just can't avoid creating new objects.

For convenience, most `WritableStream`s in Tango accepts both `T` and `Consumable<T>`.

The `MaybeConsumable<T>` type is a shorthand for `T | Consumable<T>`.

```ts showLineNumbers
import {
  Consumable,
  WritableStream,
  MaybeConsumable,
} from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const stream: WritableStream<MaybeConsumable<Uint8Array>>;

const writer = stream.getWriter();
// highlight-start
await writer.write(new Consumable(new Uint8Array([4, 5, 6]))); // works
await writer.write(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])); // also works
// highlight-end
```

This also allows a blob stream to be directly piped into them:

```ts showLineNumbers
declare const blob: File | Blob;

blob.stream().pipeTo(writable);
```

You might choose to use `Consumable<T>` when either:

- You need to re-use the buffer, so you want to track when it's consumed.
- You want to improve debugging experience by synthesizing a call stack.

### `tryConsume`

`MaybeConsumable` namespace also provides a helper method `tryConsume`. The `value` argument can be either `T` or `Consumable<T>`.

```ts showLineNumbers
declare namespace MaybeConsumable {
  export function tryConsume<T, R>(
    value: T,
    callback: (value: T extends Consumable<infer U> ? U : T) => R
  ): R;
}
```

If the `value` is a `Consumable`, it behaves the same as [`Consumable#tryConsume`](#tryconsume). If it's not, it just invokes the callback immediately with the value.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

MaybeConsumable.tryConsume(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]), (value) => {
  console.log(value); // Uint8Array [1, 2, 3]
});

MaybeConsumable.tryConsume(
  new Consumable(new Uint8Array([4, 5, 6])),
  (value) => {
    console.log(value); // Uint8Array [4, 5, 6]
  }
);

await MaybeConsumable.tryConsume(
  new Consumable(new Uint8Array([7, 8, 9])),
  async (value) => {
    // Can be async
    await delay(1000);
    console.log(value); // Uint8Array [7, 8, 9]
  }
);
```

### `WritableStream`

The `MaybeConsumable.WritableStream<T>` class combines `WritableStream<T>` and `tryConsume` to help you correctly handle the data.

```ts
import { MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

const writable = new MaybeConsumable.WritableStream<Uint8Array>({
  // `write` can be `async`
  async write(chunk) {
    console.log(chunk); // You can only use `chunk` in `write` callback
  },
});
```

You must not use the `chunk` outside the `write` callback, unless you make a copy yourself. It might be overwritten with other data after your `write` callback returns.

For example, `WebSocket`'s `send` method will copy the data into an internal transmission buffer, so it's safe to use that in `write`:

```ts transpile
import { MaybeConsumable } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const socket: WebSocket;

const writable = new MaybeConsumable.WritableStream<Uint8Array>({
  write(chunk) {
    socket.send(chunk);
  },
});
```
