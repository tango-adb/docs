## Remove one port forwarding

```ts
declare class AdbReverseCommand {
  remove(deviceAddress: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Remove a port forwarding from the device using the socket address on device.

### Example

```ts transpile
await adb.reverse.remove("tcp:1234");
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```sh
adb reverse --remove tcp:1234
```

:::

## Remove all port forwardings

```ts
declare class AdbReverseCommand {
  removeAll(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Remove all port forwardings from the device.

Be careful when using this method, as it will remove all port forwardings, including those added by other apps.

### Example

```ts transpile
await adb.reverse.removeAll();
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```sh
adb reverse --remove-all
```
