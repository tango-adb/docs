# Create transport

## Create transport for a device

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  createTransport(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector
  ): Promise<AdbTransport>;
}
```

The `AdbServerClient#createTransport` method creates an `AdbTransport` for the specified device. The device must have already been authenticated.

It accepts a [Device selector](/api/server/selector.mdx) value to specify the target device. Device selectors allow you to select a specific device in multiple ways.

In this tutorial, we will use the `AdbServerClient.Device` object we got from the previous step as a Device selector. In fact, this is the best (most precise) way to select a device.

:::note

See [Device selector](/api/server/selector.mdx) page for details.

:::

This process is asynchronous, because `AdbServerClient` needs to fetch some extra information about the device from ADB Server.

```ts transpile
import { AdbTransport } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const transport: AdbTransport = await client.createTransport(device);
```

## Create an Adb instance

The transport object only contains the lower-level logic to communicate with devices, the `Adb` class provides a higher-level abstraction over ADB protocol and ADB commands.

```ts transpile
const adb: Adb = new Adb(transport);
```
