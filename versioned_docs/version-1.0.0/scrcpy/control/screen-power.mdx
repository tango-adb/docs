# Screen power mode

Turn on or off the device screen.

Different from injecting a power key event, this command only affects the physical screen, it doesn't lock the device.

If `cleanup: true` (the default value) is set in the `ScrcpyOptions`, Scrcpy server will restore the screen state to `Normal` on exit. Pressing the physical power button twice usually turns the screen back on.

## Caveats

* On some LCD screens, turning off the screen only turns off the backlight, the screen is still visible under strong light.
* Some in-display fingerprint sensors use the screen to illuminate the finger, turning off the screen will cause them to stop working.
* Most apps are unaware of the screen state, but some apps may behave differently when the screen is off, it has been reported that:
  - Chrome for Android might not respond to touch events
  - Xiaomi HyperOS system UI loses all blur effects

## Options

```ts
export enum AndroidScreenPowerMode {
  Off = 0,
  Normal = 2,
}
```

- `Off`: Turn off the display.
- `Normal`: Turn on the display.

## Usage

```ts transpile
import { AndroidScreenPowerMode } from "@yume-chan/scrcpy";

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageSerializer`
const message: Uint8Array = serializer.setScreenPowerMode(
  AndroidScreenPowerMode.Off
);

// Using `ScrcpyControlMessageWriter`
await writer.setScreenPowerMode(AndroidScreenPowerMode.Off);

// Using `AdbScrcpyClient`
await client.controller!.setScreenPowerMode(AndroidScreenPowerMode.Off);
```
