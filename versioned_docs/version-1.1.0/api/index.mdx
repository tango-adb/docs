# Overview

This section documents all the APIs in Tango ADB libraries.

There are three sub categories:

## `Adb` from `@yume-chan/adb`:

The `Adb` class implements core ADB commands. These commands are handle by ADB Daemon on Android devices.

* [**Forward tunnel**](./adb/socket.mdx#forward-tunnel): Connect to a socket address on the device
* [`subprocess`](./adb/subprocess.mdx): Spawn processes on device
* [`power`](./adb/power.mdx): Shutdown/reboot device
* [`reverse`](./adb/reverse/index.mdx): Manage reverse port forwarding
* [`tcpip`](./adb/tcpip.mdx): Enable/disable ADB over Wi-Fi
* [`getProp`](./adb/get-prop.mdx): Shorthand for `getprop` executable
* [`rm`](./adb/rm.md): Delete files on device
* [`sync`](./adb/sync/index.mdx): Interact with device filesystem
* [`framebuffer`](./adb/framebuffer.mdx): Capture device screen

## `AdbServerClient` from `@yume-chan/adb`

The `AdbServerClient` class can communicate with Google ADB Server.

There are two types of ADB server commands:

### Commands handled by server itself

* [`getVersion`](./server/get-version.mdx): Get ADB server version
* [`killServer`](./server/kill-server.mdx): Kill ADB server
* [`getServerFeatures`](./server/get-server-features.mdx): Get ADB server features
* [`getDevices`](./server/get-devices.mdx): Get devices connected to ADB server
* [`trackDevices`](./server/track-devices.mdx): Watch devices connected to ADB server

### Commands handled by device

These commands target a specific device. All these commands accepts a [Device selector](./server/selector.mdx).

* [`getDeviceFeatures`](./server/get-device-features.mdx): Get device features
* [`createDeviceConnection`](./server/create-device-connection.mdx): Create a socket to ADB Daemon on device
* [`createTransport`](./server/create-transport.mdx): Create an `AdbTransport` object for the device
* [`waitFor`](./server/wait-for.mdx): Wait for a device to be connected or disconnected

## `@yume-chan/android-bin`

Exposed as individual classes from [`@yume-chan/android-bin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yume-chan/android-bin) package, these are abstractions over Android executables.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @yume-chan/android-bin
```

* `bu`: Backup/restore apps and data
* `bugreport`: Dump device information
* `cmd`: Interact with Android system services
* **Demo mode**: Control demo mode
* `dumpsys`: Dump system service information
* `logcat`: View device logs
    * [`binary`](./bin/logcat/binary.mdx): Read logcat entries in binary format
    * [`clear`](./bin/logcat/clear.mdx): Delete all logcat entries
* **Overlay Display** Manages simulated secondary displays
* `pm`: Manage apps
    * [`install`](./bin/pm/install.mdx): Install APK files on device filesystem
    * [`installStream`](./bin/pm/install-stream.mdx): Install APK files from a `ReadableStream`
* `settings`: Get/set Android system settings
