# Push server to device

The server file needs to be copied to the device and executed on it. It will listen on a UNIX domain socket and wait for connections from the client.

The default path of the server file on device is `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. Before version 2.3, the path of Scrcpy server binary is hard-coded in the server itself. So you must push it to this exact path, otherwise the clean up steps won't delete the server file.

:::info[Equivalent ADB command]

```bash
adb push scrcpy-server.jar /data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar
```

:::

## With `@yume-chan/scrcpy`

`@yume-chan/scrcpy` only provides APIs to serialize and deserialize Scrcpy protocol messages. It doesn't provide any APIs to interact with the device.

## With `@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy`

`@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy` package provides a `pushServer` function as a shortcut for the Tango [`AdbSync#write`](/api/adb/sync/write.mdx) call.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { AdbScrcpyClient } from "@yume-chan/adb-scrcpy";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
      controller.close();
    },
  })
);
```

By default, it pushes to `/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar`. The optional third argument allows specifying a different path.

```ts transpile
await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  new ReadableStream({
    start(controller) {
      controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
      controller.close();
    },
  }),
  "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar"
);
```

### Using `fetch`

When downloading the server binary using `fetch`, [`Response.body`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body) is a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` that can be directly piped to `pushServer`.

In theory, this is also faster, because the downloading and pushing are run in parallel. Although in practice, the server binary is too small to make a difference.

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

await AdbScrcpyClient.pushServer(
  adb,
  // The `ReadableStream` type in TypeScript `lib.dom.d.ts` is not compatible with Tango's Web Streams API typings
  response.body as never as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>
);
```

## With Tango

The above code is a shortcut for the following code:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const server: ArrayBuffer;

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    file: new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array(server));
        controller.close();
      },
    }),
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```

Or using `fetch`:

```ts transpile
import type { Adb } from "@yume-chan/adb";
import type { ReadableStream } from "@yume-chan/stream-extra";

declare const adb: Adb;
declare const url: URL;

const response = await fetch(url);

const sync = await adb.sync();
try {
  await sync.write({
    filename: "/data/local/tmp/scrcpy-server.jar",
    // The `ReadableStream` type in TypeScript `lib.dom.d.ts` is not compatible with Tango's Web Streams API typings
    file: response.body as never as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>,
  });
} finally {
  await sync.dispose();
}
```
