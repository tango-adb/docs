# Server Versions

This is an incomplete list of breaking changes in ADB server.

Because there are internal, undocumented changes, and the source code history is full of refactoring and C++ modernizing, it's difficult to find them.

Thanks https://kirschju.re/posts/listing-historic-versions-of-android-debug-bridge/ for listing ADB server versions and download links.
