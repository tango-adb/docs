# Video codec

Scrcpy 2.0 added the option to use H.265 (HEVC) and AV1 video codecs. They can provide better video quality at the same bitrate compared to H.264.

## H.264

H.264 is the default video codec. It's widely supported and provides good video quality. Most devices since Android 5 has hardware support for H.264 encoding and decoding.

## H.265 (HEVC)

H.265 is a newer video codec that provides better video quality at the same bitrate compared to H.264. However, it requires more processing power to encode and decode.

H.265 encoder is not required by Google, but many devices since Android 7 have hardware support for H.265 encoding and decoding.

## AV1

AV1 is a more recent video codec that provides even better video quality at the same bitrate compared to H.265.

Android 14 is the first version to require AV1 encoder and decoder support, and only the most recent SoCs have hardware support for AV1 encoding and decoding.

## VP9

VP9 is a video codec developed by Google. Android Studio's screen mirror feature uses VP9 to encode video, but in my testing, the device support is not as good as H.264.
