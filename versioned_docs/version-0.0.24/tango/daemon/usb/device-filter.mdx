# Device filter

WebUSB [`requestDevice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB/requestDevice#filters) method requires a `filters` option to select which devices to show in the picker.

Tango extended the filter concept to select which USB interface is used for communication with the ADB daemon.

## Filters in WebUSB API

WebUSB defines a `USBDeviceFilter` interface to be used in [`requestDevice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB/requestDevice#filters) method. It has the following fields:

```ts
interface USBDeviceFilter {
  vendorId?: number | undefined;
  productId?: number | undefined;
  classCode?: number | undefined;
  subclassCode?: number | undefined;
  protocolCode?: number | undefined;
  serialNumber?: string | undefined;
}
```

Some fields must be specified in pairs to be valid:

- When `productId` is specified, `vendorId` must also be specified.
- When `protocolCode` is specified, `subclassCode` must also be specified.
- When `subclassCode` is specified, `classCode` must also be specified.

If a filter has multiple fields, the device must match all fields to be included. For example, this filter only allows a specific manufacturer and model pair:

```ts
const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

`filters` is an array, so multiple filters can be specified. If any filter matches, the device will be included. For example, to allow multiple manufacturers/models:

```ts
const device: USBDevice = await navigator.usb.requestDevice({
  // highlight-start
  filters: [
    {
      vendorId: 0x18d1,
      productId: 0x4ee2,
    },
    {
      vendorId: 0x04e8,
      productId: 0x6860,
    },
  ],
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Filters in Tango

Because we need to know which interface to use for communication with ADB daemon, the `classCode`, `subclassCode`, and `protocolCode` fields are required. Usually they are `0xFF`, `0x42`, and `0x01` respectively, but can be different if your device has a different configuration.

```ts
interface AdbDeviceFilter {
  classCode: number;
  subclassCode: number;
  protocolCode: number;
  vendorId?: number | undefined;
  productId?: number | undefined;
  serialNumber?: string | undefined;
}
```

The `ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER` constant contains the above default values. It can be merged into your filter object:

```ts transpile
import {
  type AdbDeviceFilter,
  ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
} from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

const filters: AdbDeviceFilter[] = [
  // highlight-start
  {
    ...ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER,
    vendorId: 0x18d1,
    productId: 0x4ee2,
  },
  // highlight-end
];
```

:::note[Upcoming changes]

In next version, `ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER` will be automatically merged into the specified filters, so you don't need to do it manually.

The `AdbDeviceFilter` type will be removed, and the `filters` option will use `USBDeviceFilter` type directly (all fields are optional).

Empty `filters` array will be treated as `[ADB_DEFAULT_DEVICE_FILTER]`, so `undefined`, `[]`, `[{}]` and `[ADB_DEFAULT_INTERFACE_FILTER]` will all have the same effect.
