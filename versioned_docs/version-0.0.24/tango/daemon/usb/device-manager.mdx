# Create device manager

WebUSB provides APIs for discovering and communicating with USB devices. The `AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager` class wraps the WebUSB API to only work with ADB devices.

## Usage

The usage of `AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager` is different in Node.js and Web browsers:

<Tabs className="runtime-tabs" groupId="runtime">
<TabItem value="web" label="Web">

Chromium-based browsers support WebUSB natively. Chrome for Android is supported, but Chrome for iOS is based on Safari and not supported.

:::info[Electron Support]

- To use Tango in Electron renderer processes, see https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/devices#webusb-api for how to enable WebUSB API in Electron, then follow the instructions below
- To use Tango in Electron main processes, follow the instructions for Node.js instead

:::

:::info[Secure Context Required]

WebUSB API requires a [Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). Basically it means the page must be served over HTTPS or `localhost`.

- If you have a domain name, you can easily get a free SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- If you only have an IP address, you can create a self-signed certificate and trust it in every device that will access your server (or ignore the warning every time).

:::

Create a device manager for browsers:

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";

// highlight-start
const Manager: AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager | undefined =
  AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager.BROWSER;
// highlight-end
```

:::info

`AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager.BROWSER` is a shorthand of:

```ts
navigator.usb ? new AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager(navigator.usb) : undefined
```

:::

In two cases, `Manager` may be `undefined`:

1. Current page isn't in a [Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts)
1. Current browser does not support WebUSB API

It's your responsibility to make sure the first case doesn't happen. So there is only one reason left:

```ts transpile
if (!Manager) {
  alert("WebUSB is not supported in this browser");
  return;
}
```

<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

[`usb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usb) package provides a WebUSB implementation for Node.js.

It uses libusb library to access USB devices, which should work perfectly on Linux and macOS, but [may have some issues on Windows](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#windows).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i usb
```

Create a device manager using `WebUSB` from `usb` package:

```ts transpile
import { AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager } from "@yume-chan/adb-daemon-webusb";
import { WebUSB } from "usb";

const WebUsb: WebUSB = new WebUSB({ allowAllDevices: true });
const Manager: AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager = new AdbDaemonWebUsbDeviceManager(
  WebUsb
);
```

:::info

By default, `WebUSB` from `usb` package has the same permission system as browsers:

- Each device must be authorized separately using `requestDevice` method and [a custom `devicesFound` callback](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#use-webusb-approach-to-find-a-device-with-custom-selection-method)
- `getDevices` method only returns devices that have been authorized

Passing [`allowAllDevices: true` option](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb?tab=readme-ov-file#use-webusb-approach-to-list-all-devices) disables the permission system and returns all connected devices from `getDevices` methods.
