# Watch devices

Google ADB Server can also notify clients when devices are connected or disconnected. So you don't need to poll the server to get the latest device list.

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  trackDevices(
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): AsyncGenerator<AdbServerClient.Device[], void, void>;
}
```

The returned generator will yield the updated device list when it's changed. By using an async generator instead of a callback, it can throw errors when something goes wrong.

```ts
for await (const devices of client.trackDevices()) {
  console.log(devices);
}
```

## `signal`

An `AbortSignal` object can be passed to stop watching devices.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);

for await (const devices of client.trackDevices(controller.signal)) {
  console.log(devices);
}
```

Note that unlike many other `AbortSignal` consumers, `trackDevices` will return normally when the signal is aborted, instead of throwing `signal.reason`.

## Find changed devices

Although the generator yields the current device list, it doesn't directly tell you which device is connected or disconnected. You need to diff the device list yourself.

```ts
let lastDevices: AdbServerClient.Device[] = [];
for await (const devices of client.trackDevices()) {
  const connected = devices.filter(
    (device) =>
      !lastDevices.some((last) => last.transportId === device.transportId)
  );
  const disconnected = lastDevices.filter(
    (last) => !devices.some((device) => device.transportId === last.transportId)
  );

  console.log("Connected:", connected);
  console.log("Disconnected:", disconnected);

  lastDevices = devices;
}
```
