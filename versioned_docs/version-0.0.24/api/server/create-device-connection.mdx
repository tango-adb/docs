# createDeviceConnection

```ts
namespace AdbServerClient {
  interface Socket extends AdbSocket {
    transportId: bigint;
  }
}

declare class AdbServerClient {
  createDeviceConnection(
    device: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector,
    service: string
  ): Promise<AdbServerClient.Socket>;
}
```

Creates a socket to the ADB daemon on the device, letting the server forward packets between the client and the device.

The socket can be used to run an [ADB command](../index.mdx#adb-from-yume-chanadb), or [connect to a socket](../adb/socket.mdx#forward-tunnel) on device.

Usually you don't need to call this method directly, the `createTransport` method uses it to implement `AdbTransport`.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

There is no equivalent ADB command.
