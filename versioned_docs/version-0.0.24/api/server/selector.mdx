# Device selector

Many methods of `AdbServerClient` require a `DeviceSelector` to specify which device to operate on. This type is a union of several types, each of which represents a different way to select a device.

```ts
namespace AdbServerClient {
  type DeviceSelector =
    | { transportId: bigint }
    | { serial: string }
    | { usb: true }
    | { tcp: true }
    | undefined;
}
```

## `transportId`

Selects a device by its transport ID. This is the most reliable way to select a device, as it is unique to each connection between the server and the device. However, it will change when the device is disconnected and reconnected.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = { transportId: 1n };
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb -t <transportId> <command>
```

:::

## `serial`

Selects a device by its serial number. This is the most common way to select a device, as it is unique to each device most of the time.

However, some manufacturers use the same serial number for all devices, so it's possible that multiple devices with the same serial number will be returned.

If there are multiple devices with the same serial number, an error will be thrown.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = { serial: '1234567890ABCDEF' };
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb -s <serial> <command>
```

:::

## `usb`

Selects the only USB device. This is useful when there is only one USB device connected to the server.

If there are multiple USB devices, an error will be thrown.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = { usb: true };
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb -d <command>
```

:::

## `tcp`

Selects the only TCP device. This is useful when there is only one TCP device connected to the server.

ADB over Wi-Fi devices, Wireless Debugging devices, and local Android emulators are all considered TCP devices.

If there are multiple TCP devices, an error will be thrown.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = { tcp: true };
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb -e <command>
```

:::

## `undefined`

Selects the only device. This is useful when there is only one device connected to the server.

If there are multiple devices, an error will be thrown.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = undefined;
```

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb <command>
```

## Priority

If an object with multiple fields is used as a `DeviceSelector`, only one of the fields will be used. The fields are checked in the following order:

1. `transportId`
2. `serial`
3. `usb`
4. `tcp`

For example, `{ transportId: 1n, serial: '1234567890ABCDEF' }` will select the device with transport ID `1n`, ignoring the `serial` field.

## Use `AdbServerClient.Device`

Because `AdbServerClient.Device` has a `transportId` field, it can also be used as a `DeviceSelector`. As explained [above](#transportid), this is the best (more reliable) way to select a device.

Example:

```ts transpile
import type { AdbServerClient } from "@yume-chan/adb";

const devices: AdbServerClient.Device[] = await client.getDevices();
const device = devices[0]!;
// highlight-start
const selector: AdbServerClient.DeviceSelector = device;
// highlight-end
```
