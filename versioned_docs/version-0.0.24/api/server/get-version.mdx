# `getVersion`

```ts
declare class AdbServerClient {
  getVersion(): Promise<number>;
}
```

The protocol between ADB client and server has its own version number. This is not Android version (like `13.0`), nor ADB protocol version (like `0x10000001`), nor platform tools version (like `34.0.1`).

This is the version you see in the error message when you use a wrong ADB client to connect to a server:

```text
adb server version (39) doesn't match this client (41); killing...
```

Tango doesn't check the version number, although not thoroughly tested, most of the commands should work on any version of ADB server.

:::info[Equivalent ADB Command]

```sh
adb version
```

If it prints `Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41`, the protocol version is `41`.
